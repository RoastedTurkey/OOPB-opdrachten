//when self managing memory, always have the big three: Copy-constructor, Destructor, and Assignment operator

//copy constructor
//Broodmandje(const Broodmantje& b);

//assignment operator
//Broodmantje& operator=(const Broodmantje& b);

//Assignment: make a sad book, like the sad bread basket
//- make a book on the heap
//- make it possible for a book to be borrowed
//- multiple books
